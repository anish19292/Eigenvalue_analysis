This repository has codes for the implementation of the EigenValue Analysis (EVANS) QSPR methodology. The repository consists of Amber scripts for molecular simulations of small molecules, a VMD script for distance calculation, Excel macros for matrix manipulation, an R script for computing eigenvalues and python codes for ML model building. Detailed instructions on how to implement EVANS may be found in the user manual.
