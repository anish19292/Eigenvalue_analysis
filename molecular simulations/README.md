This directory contains Amber scripts for running MD simulations. These include the following.
(1) no_conect.sh: removes CONECT records from input structures
(2)auto-antechamber.sh: ligand parametrization using the Antechamber package.
(3)autoleap.sh: creates topologies and initial coordinates in AMBER format using the LEap program. 
(4) runMin.sh: runs equilibration  MD simulation protocol using input files (min.in for minimization, heat.in for heating, density.in for density equilibration and prod.in for production MD)
(5) remin.sh (trajectory anaysis and reminimization of the last MD frame)
